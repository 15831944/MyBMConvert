== Building hioexchange.hio ==

Before you can compile hio_exchange for linux, you MUST set the environment
variable HEXCHANGE_INSTALL_DIR.  Mine is set like this...

$ export HEXCHANGE_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/HOOPS_Exchange_4.20

You must also download HOOPS_Exchange_4.20 and extract it to /usr/local (or
somewhere else as long as your HEXCHANGE_INSTALL_DIR environment variable matches).


== Running hioexchange_test ==

You will not be able to successfully run hioexchange_test without also setting
an environment variable for the HOOP_Exchange license key.  Set the
environment variable PUBLISH_EXCHANGE_DEBUG_KEY.  My is set like this...

$ export PUBLISH_EXCHANGE_DEBUG_KEY="$CUSTOMER_KEY;$VARIABLE_KEY"

The quotes are important. You should use your own customer and variable
keys.
