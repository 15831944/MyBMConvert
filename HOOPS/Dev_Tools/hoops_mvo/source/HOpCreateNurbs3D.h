  HOpCreateNurbs3D implements three of the mouse event handlers defined on the base class to allow the user
  to interactively modify a nurbs surface by dragging it's control points with the mouse.
   
  The operation consists of the following steps:
  <ol>
  <li>Left Button Down:				The operation is initiated and control point for dragging is specified.
  <li>Left Button Down and Drag:	The control point moves with mouse position and the surface is recalculated.
  <li>Left Button Up:				The surface editing is finalized.
  </ol>
  More Detailed Description: see event methods.
