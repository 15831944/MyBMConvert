README.TXT

This is the readable source code of the HOOPS/Stream hookup to the HOOPS 3D Graphics System 
and uses the extensive query and search capabilities of 3dGS.  This is provided as a detailed 
example of what would be involved in creating an interface to a full featured graphics system.  
By design this code does not use the public interface to the base stream classes but rather 
derives from them and accesses their protected and private members of the classes as needed.
