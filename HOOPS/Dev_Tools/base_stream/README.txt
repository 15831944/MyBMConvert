This is HOOPS/Stream version 15.0


This is the Read/Write SDK for the HOOPS Stream File format. 
The package includes the libraries, headers and source for the 
HOOPS/Stream Toolkit as well as example programs, a sample viewer
you can use to test your HSFs and a set of documentation that
should help you to quickly start reading or writing HSFs.  The 
HOOPS Stream File (HSF) format is an open, customizable, highly 
compressed 2D/3D visualization format specifically tailored to the 
needs of displaying engineering data.


New users are encouraged to start by reading the documentation 
that is contained in the hsf_docs directory.  Specifically, 
you should load index.html into your web browser and use the 
navigation bar on the left side to load the 'Programming Guide' 
section that is a great starting point as you try to orient 
yourself with the HSF technology.  The 'Supported Platforms' 
section in that same menu details the specific compilers and 
operating systems supported with this release.


There are also a number of sample programs that can be used 
for reference in the examples directory.  The simple directory 
contains some basic standalone programs that create example 
HSFs while the 3dGS folder contains the source code to the 
implementation used within HOOPS/3dGS.  It is not intended 
that the code within the 3dGS directory compiles but rather 
it is included as a reference as to how you may use some of 
the opcodes that are not used in the simple programs.


Additionally, the HOOPS Developer Zone, located at 
http://developer.hoops3d.com
is a great resource for technical information pertaining
to the HOOPS technology.  It includes on-line versions of
our documentation and access to the latest releases.


Finally, if you have any problems with the HOOPS media don't 
hesitate to contact us via support@techsoft3d.com.


Have fun!
